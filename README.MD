# Speech Emotion Recognition
Communication based on emotions is an important capability. Detecting the emotional state of a speaker from speech aids in extraction of important semantic information. Automatic speech emotion recognition is a challenging task due to the
discontinuity between acoustic features and human emotions.

## Motivation
- To achieve truly effective HCI interaction, there is a need for computers to be able to interact naturally with humans.
- ‘Behavioural Biometrics’ is an upcoming field which deals with utilizing behaviour information like emotions as these traits are impossible to steal.
